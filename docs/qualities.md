# Measuring the quality of code

Maintainability
- Single Responsibility Principle
  - does the class have only one responsibility?
  - Examples: 
    - Layered architecture
  - Situations: 
    - Testability
    - Reusability(repository)
    - Can develop on abstractions(APIエンドポイントとかDBとかあとでできる)
    - Maintainability: 変えてないことろもチェックする必要がある
- Open Closed Principle
  - is the class open for extension
  - is the class closed for modification
  - Examples: 
    - Strongly typed system
    - Campaign book rental
- Liskov Substitution Principle
  - does the child class still behave the same as the parent?
  - Examples: 
- Interface Segregation Principle
  - do you have to implement useless methods?
  - Examples: 
    - Premium user
- Dependency Inversion Principle
  - are you depending on abstractions?
  - are you depending on concrete implementations
  - Examples: 
    - Repos
    - Premium User?
- コード書くときの手間
